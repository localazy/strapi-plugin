## Installation & Setup

The plugin is available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@localazy/strapi-plugin).
You can also follow the installation commands located in your Strapi project Marketplace or [Strapi Marketplace > Localazy](https://market.strapi.io/plugins/@localazy-strapi-plugin) itself. This is the recommended approach.

```
npm install @localazy/strapi-plugin@latest && npx @localazy/strapi-plugin
```

Note: Localazy plugin requires an updated Webpack configuration of your Strapi project. Follow the instructions in the console output during the installation process. Steps are also available in the [Install plugin via NPM](https://localazy.com/docs/strapi/strapi-plugin-introduction-installation#install-plugin-via-npm) section of the Localazy Docs.

Due to the changes in Strapi core code it's also necessary to add an environment variable to your Strapi project. Add the following line to your `.env` file (value is empty):

```
STRAPI_ADMIN_LOCALAZY_ENV=
```

## Configuration

Additional configuration object may be provided in the `plugins.js` file. The following options are available:

```js
localazy: {
    config: {
      /**
       * both options may help guard against DoS attacks
       * if `populateMaxDepth` < 5; the Localazy Strapi Plugin may not work as expected
       */
      populateDefaultDepth?: number, // default is 5
      populateMaxDepth?: number, // default is 10
    },
  },
```
