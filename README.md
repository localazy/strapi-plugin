📰 Learn more in the [Strapi + Localazy tutorial](https://localazy.com/blog/how-to-strapi-localization-with-localazy#getting-started-with-strapi-localization).

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

The plugin is available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@localazy/strapi-plugin).
You can also follow the installation commands located in your Strapi project Marketplace or [Strapi Marketplace > Localazy](https://market.strapi.io/plugins/@localazy-strapi-plugin) itself. This is the recommended approach.

```
npm install @localazy/strapi-plugin@latest && npx @localazy/strapi-plugin
```

Note: Localazy plugin requires an updated bundler configuration of your Strapi project. Follow the instructions in the console output during the installation process. Steps are also available in the [Install plugin via NPM](https://localazy.com/docs/strapi/strapi-plugin-introduction-installation#install-plugin-via-npm) section of the Localazy Docs.

Plugin supports automatic recognition of a bundler configuration. If you are using either Vite or Webpack, respectively, the plugin will automatically create an example configuration file for you.

Due to the changes in Strapi core code it's also necessary to add an environment variable to your Strapi project. Add the following line to your `.env` file (value is empty):

```
STRAPI_ADMIN_LOCALAZY_ENV=
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Additional configuration object may be provided in the `plugins.js` file. The following options are available:

```js
localazy: {
    config: {
      /**
       * both options may help guard against DoS attacks
       * if `populateMaxDepth` < 5; the Localazy Strapi Plugin may not work as expected
       */
      populateDefaultDepth?: number, // default is 5
      populateMaxDepth?: number, // default is 10
      skipCreatorFields?: boolean, // default is false
      enableSocketIO?: boolean, // default is true
    },
  },
```

## 🔐 Access control (RBAC)

The plugin registers four Strapi permission actions, visible under
**Settings → Administration Panel → Roles → Plugins → Localazy** and
**Settings → Administration Panel → Roles → Settings → Localazy**:

| Action                                                              | Unlocks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Localazy → Read` (`plugin::localazy.read`)                         | Localazy menu link, Overview, Activity Logs (list + detail), Content-Manager side panel & Localazy status column, read endpoints (identity, project, models, plugin settings, sync cursor, activity logs, troubleshooting bundle, entry-exclusion state). |
| `Localazy → Transfer` (`plugin::localazy.transfer`)                 | Upload, Download, Entry Exclusion mutations (incl. Content-Manager bulk actions), Activity Log session clearing.                                                                                                                                          |
| `Localazy → Settings → Read` (`plugin::localazy.settings.read`)     | Localazy Settings pages (Global Settings, Content Transfer Setup) and reading their config.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Localazy → Settings → Update` (`plugin::localazy.settings.update`) | **Connecting / disconnecting the Localazy account**, webhook setup, updating Content Transfer Setup, and updating Global Settings.                                                                                                                        |

Server is the enforcement perimeter — all admin-typed plugin routes are
gated by `admin::hasPermissions`, so UI gates are convenience only.

### Upgrade note

Strapi grants new actions to the **Super Admin** role automatically. **Other
roles (Editor, Author, custom roles) keep no Localazy access until an admin
re-grants the actions** under _Settings → Administration Panel → Roles →
Plugins → Localazy_. Plan this step when upgrading from `<= 1.4.x`.
