## Setup

### Install the plugin via NPM

The plugin is available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@localazy/strapi-plugin).
You can also follow the installation commands located in your Strapi project Marketplace. This is the recommended approach.

```
npm install @localazy/strapi-plugin
```

### Use the plugin in a clean project locally

Besides installing the plugin via `npm`, you can also use it in a project locally. Assuming you have a (clean) Strapi project set up, do:

1. Copy the whole contents.
2. Paste it into `./src/plugin/localazy` folder of your project (path from project root).
3. Create `./config/plugins.js` file (path from project root).
4. Add the following contents to `./config/plugins.js` file:

```
module.exports = {
  localazy: {
    enabled: true,
    resolve: "./src/plugins/localazy",
    config: {
      default: () => {},
      validator: () => {},
    },
  },
};
```

5. Run the project. The plugin will be available in the admin.

### Tests

To run tests, run the `npm run test` command. To watch tests, run the `npm run test:watch` command.
